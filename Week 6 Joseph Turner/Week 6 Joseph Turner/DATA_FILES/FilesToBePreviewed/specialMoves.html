	<h3>Castling</h3>

	<p>Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it.[2] Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved;
		<li>There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
		<li>The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square);
		<li>The king and the rook must be on the same rank (Schiller 2003:19).[3]
	</ul>	
	
	<h3>En passant</h3>

	<p>If a white pawn moves forward two squares and Black has a pawn on the fourth rank on an adjacent file, Black can capture White's pawn as if the white pawn had moved only one square. This capture can be made only on the immediately subsequent move. In this example, if the white pawn moves a2–a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant, ending up on a3.</p>

	<h3>Pawn promotion</h3>

	<p>If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted. If the desired piece is not available, the player should call the arbiter to provide the piece (Schiller 2003:17–19).[4].</p>
	
	<h3>Check</h3>

	<p>A king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check (it is pinned against its own king) may still deliver check to the opposing player.</p>

	<p>A player may not make any move which places or leaves his king in check. The possible ways to get out of check are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Move the king to a square where it is not threatened.
		<li>Capture the threatening piece (possibly with the king).
		<li>Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece (Just & Burg 2003:27), (Polgar & Truong 2005:32,103), (Burgess 2009:550).
	</ul>

	<p>If it is not possible to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the game is over (see the next section).</p>

	<p>In informal games, it is customary to announce "check" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. However, in formal competitions check is rarely announced (Just & Burg 2003:28).</p>
