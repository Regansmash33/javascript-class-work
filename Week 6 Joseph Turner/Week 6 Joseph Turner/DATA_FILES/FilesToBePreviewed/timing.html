	<h2>Timing <span style="font-size:11pt;">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</span></h2>
	
	<p>Photo shows a digital chess clock. There are two clocks, one on each side and a button on top of each stops that clock and starts the other
	Digital game clock.</p>
	
	<p>Tournament games are played under time constraints, called time controls, using a game clock. Each player must make his moves within the time control or forfeit the game. There are different types of time controls. In some cases each player will have a certain amount of time to make a certain number of moves. In other cases each player will have a limited amount of time to make all of his moves. Also, the player may gain a small amount of additional time for each move made, either by a small increment added for each move made, or by the clock delaying a small amount of time each time it is started after the opponent's move (Schiller 2003:21–24).</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If a player delivers a checkmate, the game is over and that player wins, no matter what is subsequently noticed about the time on the clock.
			<li>If player A calls attention to player B being out of time while player A is not out of time and some sequence of legal moves leads to B being checkmated then player A wins automatically.
			<li>If player A does not have the possibility of checkmating B then the game is a draw (Schiller 2003:28).
		</ul>

	<p>The United States Chess Federation (USCF) rule is different. USCF Rule 14E defines "insufficient material to win on time", that is lone king, king plus knight, king plus bishop, and king plus two knights opposed by no pawns, and there is no forced win in the final position. Hence to win on time with this material, the USCF rule requires that a win can be forced from that position, while the FIDE rule merely requires a win to be possible. (See Monika Soćko rules appeal in 2008 and Women's World Chess Championship 2008 for a famous instance of this rule.)</p>

		<ul>
			<li>If a player is out of time and also calls attention to his opponent running out of time, then:
				<ul>
					<li>If a sudden death time control is not being used, the game continues in the next time control period (Schiller 2003:23).
					<li>if the game is played under a sudden death time control, then if it can be established which player ran out of time first, the game is lost by that player; otherwise the game is drawn (Schiller 2003:29).
				</ul>

	<p>If a player believes that his opponent is attempting to win the game on time and not by normal means (i.e. checkmate), if it is a sudden death time control and the player has less than two minutes remaining, the player may stop the clocks and claim a draw with the arbiter. The arbiter may declare the game a draw or postpone the decision and allot the opponent two extra minutes (Schiller 2003:21–24,29).</p>
